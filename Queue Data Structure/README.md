Certainly! Here are more details on the second task, which involves implementing a Queue data structure in TypeScript:

Task: Implement a Queue Data Structure

1. Create a TypeScript file (e.g., queue.ts) and define a Queue class.

2. Inside the Queue class, you will need to define a private array property to store the elements of the queue. You can name this property `elements` and initialize it as an empty array.

3. Implement the following methods for the Queue class:

   - `enqueue(element)`: This method adds an element to the back of the queue.
   - `dequeue()`: This method removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
   - `peek()`: This method returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
   - `isEmpty()`: This method checks if the queue is empty and returns a boolean value.

4. Use generics in TypeScript to ensure type safety. Define the `T` type parameter in the class declaration and use it in the method signatures to specify the type of elements stored in the queue.

5. Implement each method based on the corresponding functionality:

   - In `enqueue`, you can use the `push` method to add the element to the back of the `elements` array.
   - In `dequeue`, you can use the `shift` method to remove and return the element from the front of the `elements` array.
   - In `peek`, you can access the first element of the `elements` array without modifying the array.
   - In `isEmpty`, you can check if the length of the `elements` array is zero.

6. Test your implementation by creating an instance of the Queue class and performing various operations, such as adding elements, removing elements, peeking at the front element, and checking if the queue is empty.


// Testing the Queue class
const queue = new Queue<number>();
queue.enqueue(1);
queue.enqueue(2);
queue.enqueue(3);
console.log(queue.dequeue());  // Output: 1
console.log(queue.peek());     // Output: 2
console.log(queue.isEmpty());  // Output: false
console.log(queue.dequeue());  // Output: 2
console.log(queue.dequeue());  // Output: 3
console.log(queue.isEmpty());  // Output: true
```


The class uses generics with the type parameter `T` to ensure type safety. This allows you to create a queue of any specific type.

We create an instance of the Queue class, enqueue elements (in this case, numbers), and perform various operations to test the implementation.

Feel free to modify and expand this code to suit your needs.
