Certainly! Here are more details on the first task, which involves creating a Calculator class in TypeScript:

Task: Create a Calculator Class

1. Create a TypeScript file (e.g., calculator.ts) and define a Calculator class.

2. Inside the Calculator class, implement methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can name the methods `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` respectively.

3. Each method should take in two parameters of type `number` and return the computed result.

4. Implement the necessary TypeScript types for the method parameters and return values to enforce type safety. For example, the `add` method should have the signature: `add(num1: number, num2: number): number`.

5. Test your implementation by creating an instance of the Calculator class and calling each method with different inputs. For example:

   ```typescript
   const calculator = new Calculator();
   console.log(calculator.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
   console.log(calculator.subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
   console.log(calculator.multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20
   console.log(calculator.divide(10, 2)); // Output: 5
   ```

6. Ensure that your methods handle different types of input correctly. For instance, if the `add` method receives string inputs, it should throw an error or return `NaN` instead of concatenating the strings.

7. Experiment with additional functionality or features in your Calculator class if desired. For example, you could add a method to calculate the square root or handle floating-point precision.

By completing this task, you will practice implementing a class with methods in TypeScript, enforcing type safety, and handling different types of input. It will help you become more familiar with TypeScript's syntax and features.
