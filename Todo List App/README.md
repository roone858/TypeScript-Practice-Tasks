Certainly! Here are more details on the third task, which involves building a Todo List application using TypeScript:

Task: Build a Todo List Application

1. Create a TypeScript file (e.g., todoList.ts) and define a TodoList class.

2. Inside the TodoList class, you will need to define a private array property to store the tasks of the todo list. You can name this property `tasks` and initialize it as an empty array.

3. Define an interface for the task object structure. It should include properties such as `id`, `title`, `description`, and `completed`. For example:

   ```typescript
   interface Task {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     completed: boolean;
   }
   ```

4. Implement the following methods for the TodoList class:

   - `addTask(task: Task): void`: This method adds a task to the todo list.
   - `markTaskAsCompleted(taskId: number): void`: This method marks a task as completed based on its ID.
   - `displayTasks(): void`: This method displays the list of tasks in the console or on a web page.

5. Use TypeScript types and interfaces to enforce type safety. For example, the `addTask` method should accept a parameter of type `Task` and the `markTaskAsCompleted` method should accept a parameter of type `number` (the task ID).

6. Implement each method based on the corresponding functionality:

   - In `addTask`, you can use the `push` method to add the task to the `tasks` array.
   - In `markTaskAsCompleted`, you can iterate over the `tasks` array to find the task with the given ID and update its `completed` property.
   - In `displayTasks`, you can use console.log or any other method to display the tasks stored in the `tasks` array.

7. Test your implementation by creating an instance of the TodoList class, adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and displaying the list of tasks.

By completing this task, you will practice using TypeScript interfaces, working with arrays, and implementing methods to manage and display a todo list. You can enhance the application by adding additional features such as task deletion or filtering based on completion status.
