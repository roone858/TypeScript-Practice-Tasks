Task: Create a Weather App

In this task, you will create a Weather App using TypeScript. The Weather App will retrieve weather data from an API and display it to the user.

Here are more details on how to approach this task:

1. Set up the project:
   - Create a new directory for your Weather App project.
   - Initialize a new TypeScript project using a package manager like npm or yarn.
   - Set up a basic project structure with necessary files (e.g., index.html, styles.css, etc.).

2. Design the user interface:
   - Determine the layout and design of your Weather App. You can use HTML, CSS, and any front-end framework or library of your choice.
   - Consider including components such as search bar, weather details, forecast, etc., based on the desired functionality of your app.

3. Obtain an API key:
   - Sign up for a weather API service that provides weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.).
   - Obtain an API key that you can use to make requests to the weather API.

4. Implement the functionality:
   - Create a TypeScript file (e.g., weatherApp.ts) to write your application logic.
   - Define classes, interfaces, and functions to handle the retrieval and processing of weather data.

5. Fetch weather data from the API:
   - Use the Fetch API or any HTTP library of your choice to make a request to the weather API.
   - Include the necessary query parameters such as the location (city, ZIP code, latitude/longitude) and your API key.

6. Process and display the weather data:
   - Receive the weather data from the API response.
   - Parse and extract the relevant information, such as current temperature, weather conditions, forecast, etc.
   - Update the user interface dynamically with the retrieved weather data.

7. Handle errors and edge cases:
   - Implement error handling for cases like invalid user input, failed API requests, etc.
   - Display appropriate error messages to the user in case of failures.

8. Test your Weather App:
   - Run your application and test it by searching for different locations and verifying that the weather data is displayed correctly.
   - Test the error handling functionality by intentionally triggering errors and ensuring they are handled gracefully.

9. Optional enhancements:
   - Add additional features like displaying weather icons, hourly forecasts, multiple-day forecasts, etc.
   - Implement user settings, such as the choice of temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit) or preferred language.
   - Add geolocation functionality to automatically fetch the weather based on the user's current location.

By completing this task, you will gain experience in building a web application using TypeScript, working with APIs, handling asynchronous operations, and displaying data dynamically. Remember to follow good coding practices, modularize your code, and ensure readability and maintainability.

Note: Make sure to review the terms and conditions of the weather API you choose to use, as some may have usage limitations or require attribution.
