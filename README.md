Sure! Here are some TypeScript tasks you can practice:

1. Task: Create a Calculator Class
   Create a Calculator class with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Implement the necessary TypeScript types and ensure the methods handle different types of input (e.g., numbers, strings, etc.) correctly.

2. Task: Implement a Queue Data Structure
   Implement a Queue class using TypeScript. The class should have methods for enqueue, dequeue, and peek, and it should enforce type safety. Test your implementation by adding and removing elements from the queue.

3. Task: Build a Todo List Application
   Create a TodoList class with methods for adding a task, marking a task as completed, and displaying the list of tasks. Use TypeScript interfaces to define the task object structure and enforce type safety throughout the application.

4. Task: Implement a Binary Search Tree
   Implement a Binary Search Tree (BST) class using TypeScript. The class should have methods for inserting elements, searching for an element, and traversing the tree (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order). Make sure to define TypeScript interfaces for the tree nodes and enforce type safety.

5. Task: Create a Weather App
   Build a simple weather application that fetches weather data from an API using TypeScript. Use interfaces to define the structure of the weather data and ensure type safety. Display the weather information on a web page or in the console.

6. Task: Design a Shape Hierarchy
   Create an abstract Shape class and extend it with different types of shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) using TypeScript. Each shape should have methods for calculating its area and perimeter. Test your implementation by creating instances of different shapes and calling the appropriate methods.

These tasks should provide you with a variety of TypeScript challenges to practice and enhance your skills. Good luck!
